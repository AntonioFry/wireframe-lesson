## Block Level Elements vs Inline Elements

Block: Generally block level elements will always start a new line and take up it's own space on a page. Other properties include block level elements being able to contain other elements. This side can be a little bit more complicated when compared to inline elements.

Inline: Inline elements more closely resemble what their name suggests. Unlike block level elements, they don't disrupt the flow of the page and content and don't start on their own line when being rendered. For example 'img' tags are considered inline due to the fact that if between tags with text they flow as if it were a part of the text.
